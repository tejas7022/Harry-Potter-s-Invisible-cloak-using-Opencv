# Harry Potter's Invisible Cloak

This is simply a program that uses color segmentation and a bit of image processing to replace the foreground object of interest with the background.

You can take a unicolor bedsheet and apply color segmentation on it. After that take a picture of the background and place the bedsheet over yourself to virtually disappear, or make some part of your body disappear.

## Dependencies:
  1. Python 3
  2. Numpy
  3. OpenCV (Python)
 
## Installation for Python 3
  Visit: https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the version suitable for your System
  
## Installation for Numpy
  Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Linux) and type in the following command:
     
     pip install numpy
  
  Visit: https://scipy.org/install.html for details.
  
 ## Installation for OpenCV
  Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Linux) and type in the following command:
     
     pip install opencv-python
  
  Visit: https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/ for details.

## Algorithm
 - Convert RGB to HSV and select a range, which is used to segment the color
 - Create a mask with the segmented HSV color
 - Apply Morphological Operations (Closing) to fill out holes in the mask. Make sure you use appropiate kernel/filter size. 10 works for my case. 
 - Find all the contours using OpenCV function and then arrange them in descending order in terms of Area. 
 - Select the largest contour and create a complete mask of that using polynomial fill function. 
 - With that mask, create object and background masks
 - Bitwise OR the background and object masks in order to replace the object of interest with the background
 - Repeat this for every frame

## How to use?
  1. Run the Invisible Cloak.py (While Running it, make sure nobody is infront of the webcam)
  2. An window showing the background image will pop up. 

# Note
The HSV values are calculated for the following cloth color. But you may have to re-define your values to make it work for other colors.
